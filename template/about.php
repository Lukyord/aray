                                    A Design & Build studio. The essence of ARAY is the balance between differentiated design and quality with the belief in delivering service with a sense of warmth to achieve aspirations.
                                    <br><br>We believes it is essential to provide our particular way of designing and building space with the dedication to the highest quality of customer service. With great attention to the interplay of the selected materials, natural light ash cabinets and semi-transparent partitions create a stimulating presenceâ€”plays of light, shadows, and natural color create a certain depth.
